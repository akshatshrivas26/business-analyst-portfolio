Outcomes (Projected)
KPI	Current	Target
Escalation Rate	11.8%	<5%
Resolution Time	9.1 min	~7.2 min
First Touch Resolution	61%	75–80%
CSAT	3.6 / 5	≥ 4.2 / 5
Key Takeaways

Escalations increased primarily due to process design issues, not customer behavior or agent performance.

Automation, role separation, and content accuracy significantly reduce friction points in support workflows.

The redesigned workflow focuses on preventing escalations rather than reacting to them.
